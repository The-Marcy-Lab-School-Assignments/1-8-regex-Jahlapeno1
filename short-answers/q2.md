# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer
RegEx would be beneficial when we want to find a specific set of characters in a string. Like the phone number and email problems in this assignment. This would take a bunch of if else statements and loops without RegEx.
