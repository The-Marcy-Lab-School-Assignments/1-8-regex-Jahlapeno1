# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
In order to replace all instances of a pettern with `.replace()` we would have to use the `g` flag at the end.

Example
```js
/idk/g
```
